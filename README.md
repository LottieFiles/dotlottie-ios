> üöß **Beta Alert:** We're still refining! The APIs in this package may undergo changes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently supported platforms ‚ö†Ô∏è

- iPhone, iPhone Simulator (x86), MacOS (x86, ARM)


Note: This is due to the compilation of Thorvg. We're working on supporting more platforms!

## Usage

1. Install the dependancy

Via the Swift Package Manager

To install via Swift Package Manager, in the package finder in Xcode, search for LottieFiles/dotlottie-ios or use the full Github path: https://github.com/LottieFiles/dotlottie-ios

2. Import DotLottie

```swift
import DotLottie
```

3. How to use

The ```DotLottieAnimation``` class will store the playback settings of your animation. It will also allow you to control playback via the play / pause functions.

3a. SwiftUI

Set up DotLottieAnimation inside a View. Optionally pass playback settings.

```swift
struct AnimationView: View {
    var body: some View {
        DotLottieAnimation(fileName: "cool_animation", autoplay: true, loop: true).view()
    }
}
```


In the above example, you reference the name of a .lottie asset bundled inside your application, but you can also load in a .lottie file hosted on a web URL:

```swift
struct AnimationView: View {
    var body: some View {
        DotLottieAnimation(
            webURL: "https://lottie.host/link.lottie"
        ).view()
    }
}
```

3b. UIKit - Storyboard

Coming soon!

3c. UIKit - Programmatic approach

```swift
class AnimationViewController: UIViewController {
    var simpleVM = DotLottieAnimation(webURL: "https://lottie.host/link.lottie", autoplay: true, loop: false)
    
    override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        let dotLottieView = simpleVM.createDotLottieView()
        view.addSubview(dotLottieView)
    }
}
```

## Development

### How to build thorvg.xcframework

(Only for maintainers of the repository)

- Pull the Thorvg submodule:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

- Go in to the Thorvg folder:

```bash
cd Sources/Thorvg/
```

- Run the ```build_thorvg.sh``` script:

```bash
sh build_thorvg.sh -h
```

- How to cross compile for your architecture:

For example if you're on a x86 based CPU:

```bash
sh build_thorvg.sh iphone_sim_x86_64 macos_x86_64 
```

For example if you're on a ARM basd CPU:

```bash
sh build_thorvg.sh iphone_sim_aarch macos_aarch 
```

Build for real iPhone device:

```bash
sh build_thorvg.sh iphone_aarch
```
